# Mutation Sets 

## Mutation datasets

- Humsavar
: Deleterious mutations and polymorphisms currated by UniProt. Contains mutations associated with different heritable diseases and cancers, as well as polymorphisms.

- ClinVar
: Deleterious mutations and polymorphisms currated by UniProt.

- COSMIC
: Mutations that have been found by sequencing cancer cells. Not clear which mutations are "drivers" and which mutations are passengers.

- [DoCM](http://docm.genome.wustl.edu/)
: Database of Curated Mutations. Contains **currated** mutations which are **known** to be drivers in cancer.


## Small-scale studies

- [CAGI4 SUMO ligase](https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/4-SUMO_ligase)
: Mutatons affecting the  activity of human SUMO ligase (UBE2l), measured using a high-throughput yeast complementation assay.


## Notes:

- A good application for semi-supervised learning would be to train on COSMIC + DoCM.
